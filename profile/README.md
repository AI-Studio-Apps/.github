  <sub>Building lightweight, transparent tools for running AI—locally or via your own cloud endpoint.</sub>

### 🎯 What We Do
We create **open-source, educational utilities** that let you:
- ✅ Run **local LLMs** (Llama, Mistral, Phi, etc.) on your own hardware  
- ✅ Connect to **cloud-hosted models** using your own API key & base URL  
- ✅ Generate images, analyze text, and experiment with AI **without vendor lock-in**  
- ✅ Learn how AI apps work—through simple, readable, MIT-licensed code

All projects are designed to be **privacy-respecting**, **offline-capable**, and **easy to audit**.

### 🧪 Featured Project: [`vibe-code`](https://github.com/AI-Studio-Apps/vibe-code)
A sandbox for AI experimentation:
- Image generation with local/cloud models  
- Prompt engineering playgrounds  
- Knowledge retrieval demos  
- Utilities for developers & educators  

> Built for learning—not production. Fork, tweak, and run it yourself.

### 🔒 Philosophy
- **No telemetry. No tracking. No hidden APIs.**  
- **Your data stays yours**—whether you’re on a laptop or a server.  
- **Code clarity > features**—if you can’t understand it, you can’t trust it.

### 🤝 Join Us
We welcome contributors who believe AI should be:
- **Accessible** (runs on modest hardware)  
- **Transparent** (open weights, open code)  
- **Educational** (great for students, makers, and curious minds)
